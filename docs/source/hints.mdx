title: Composition hints
---

When you successfully [compose](./federated-types/composition) the schemas provided by your [subgraphs](./building-supergraphs/subgraphs-overview/) into a supergraph schema, the composition process can flag potential improvements. Specifically, composition can output violations of the [GraphOS schema linter's](/graphos/delivery/schema-linter) [composition rules](/graphos/delivery/linter-rules#composition-rules) in GraphOS Studio or via the [Rover CLI](/rover/). The [`rover subgraph check`](/rover/commands/subgraphs#subgraph-check) command outputs rule violations with the [severity levels](/graphos/delivery/schema-linter/#setting-severity-levels) you've configured for your graph variant. [`rover supergraph compose`](/rover/commands/supergraphs#supergraph-compose) outputs all rule violations. 

See below for a list of composition rules with the code that GraphOS returns for each rule violation. Rules are categorized by rule type. Refer to the [rules reference page](./linter-rules) for a comprehensive list of linter rules.
